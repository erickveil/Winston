# Winston

Winston is the working name for this app until I've come up with a better one.

This app is a "Tarot Card" app.

## Phase 1 (✔ Complete!)

- User can click a button. It will describe the card drawn, its orientation, its meaning.

## Phase 2 (✔ Complete!)

- The app will display the drawn card.

## Phase 3

- The user can enter a "question" in a text box.
- When the card is drawn, a REST call will be made to a LLM API.
- The app will also respond with a generated inteperetation based on the card and its meaning.

## Phase 4

- Option for two card spreads

## Phase 5

- Option for other spread types
